### I'm Uzziel

A **Software Engineering student** and currently a **Software Engineering and Data Intern at a financial company in Mexico**.  

I spend most of my time working with **Python**, especially handling and processing data at work. I also have a lot of experience with **React** and **TypeScript** for web applications, some **Java** and **C++** from school projects.  

I love building systems and tools that make people's lives easier, exploring new technologies, new experiences, and solving challenging problems.
