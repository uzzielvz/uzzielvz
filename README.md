### I'm Uzziel

A **Software Engineering student** and currently a **Software & Data Intern** at a financial company in Mexico.  

I spend most of my time at work using **Python** for data processing, and I have strong experience with **Java**, along with **React** and **TypeScript** for web applications. I also have some exposure to **C++ and C**  from school projects.  

I love building systems and tools that make people's lives easier, exploring new technologies, experiences, and solving challenging problems.
