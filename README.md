### I'm Uzziel

A **Software Engineering student** and currently a **Software Engineering and Data Intern at a financial company in Mexico**.  

I spend most of my time working with **Python**, especially handling and processing data at work. I also have a lot of experience with **React** for web applications, some **TypeScript**, and **Java** from school projects.  

I enjoy building tools and automations that make workflows easier, experimenting with new technologies, and tackling challenging problems.
